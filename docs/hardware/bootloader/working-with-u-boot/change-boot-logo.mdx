# **Changing Boot Logo in U-Boot**

This guide explains how to load and display a custom boot logo in U-Boot. You can load the splash screen from different storage devices, such as MMC/SD, USB, or use a preloaded image stored in the U-Boot binary.

---

## **1. Loading and Displaying a Boot Logo in U-Boot**

### **1.1 Loading from MMC/SD Card**

To load a BMP image from an MMC/SD card:

```bash
mmc dev 0          # Select MMC/SD card
mmc rescan         # Rescan for storage devices
load mmc 0 ${loadaddr} <bmp file name>  # Load BMP file into memory
bmp display ${loadaddr}  # Display the image
```

**Example:**

```bash
mmc dev 2
mmc rescan
load mmc 2 ${loadaddr} splash/logo.bmp
bmp display ${loadaddr}
```

### **1.2 Loading from USB Storage**

To load a BMP image from a USB storage device:

```bash
usb start          # Start USB subsystem
load usb <device number> ${loadaddr} <bmp file name>  # Load BMP file
bmp display ${loadaddr}  # Display the image
```

**Example:**

```bash
usb start
load usb 0 ${loadaddr} splash/logo.bmp
bmp display ${loadaddr}
```

## **2. Preloading Splash Screen from eMMC/SD/USB**

Instead of embedding the splash screen in the U-Boot binary, you can configure U-Boot to automatically load the logo from a FAT partition on an eMMC, SD card, or USB storage.

### **2.1 Setting Up Automatic Splash Screen Loading**

To configure U-Boot to load a splash screen automatically:

1. Ensure the splash screen file is stored in a FAT partition.
2. Set the `splashfile` variable to point to the splash screen image.
3. Set the `splashsource` variable to specify the storage device.
4. Save the environment variables.
5. Restart the system.

```bash
setenv splashfile /boot/logo.bmp  # Set splash screen file path
setenv splashsource mmc_fs        # Specify source storage (e.g., mmc_fs, usb_fs)
saveenv                            # Save environment settings
reset                              # Reboot to apply changes
```

**Example for eMMC:**

```bash
setenv splashfile /boot/logo.bmp
setenv splashsource mmc_fs
saveenv
reset
```

**Example for USB:**

```bash
setenv splashfile /boot/logo.bmp
setenv splashsource usb_fs
saveenv
reset
```

## **3. Additional Notes**

- Ensure that the BMP file is in a compatible format (e.g., 24-bit uncompressed BMP).
- `loadaddr` should be set to a valid memory address where the image will be loaded.
- Use `printenv` to check current environment variables.
- If the splash screen does not appear, check the storage device and file path.

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to changing the boot logo in U-Boot using different methods. Depending on your use case, you can either load the logo manually or configure it for automatic loading during boot.
