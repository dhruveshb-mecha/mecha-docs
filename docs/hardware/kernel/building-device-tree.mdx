## 1. Introduction to Device Tree

### What is a Device Tree?

A Device Tree (DT) is a data structure used in embedded Linux systems to describe hardware components and their configurations to the Linux kernel. It eliminates the need for hardcoded board-specific information in the kernel source code.

### What is a Device Tree Blob (DTB)?

The Device Tree Blob (DTB) is a compiled binary representation of the Device Tree Source (DTS) file. The Linux kernel reads the DTB during boot to configure hardware settings properly.

### Why is the Device Tree Important?

- It provides flexibility to configure hardware without modifying kernel source code.
- It defines how peripherals (I2C, SPI, UART, etc.) interact with the SoC.
- It allows enabling/disabling specific hardware components dynamically.

## 2. Locating and Modifying the DTS File

### Step 1: Identifying the Relevant DTS File

For the **Mecha Comet** device, the top-level DTB file used by the kernel is:

```
arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/imx8mm-mecha-comet-m-gen1.dtb
```

This DTB is generated from the corresponding **DTS file**:

```
arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/imx8mm-mecha-comet-m-gen1.dts
```

This DTS file may include other files such as:

```
arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/imx8mm-mecha-som-gen1.dts
```

These included files define common hardware configurations for the Mecha Comet platform.

### Step 2: Editing the DTS File

To modify the DTS file:

1. Open the DTS file in a text editor:
    
    ```
    nano arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/imx8mm-mecha-comet-m-gen1.dts
    ```
    
2. Locate the node you want to modify. A typical node looks like this:
    
    ```
    &i2c2 {
        status = "disabled";
    };
    ```
    
3. Modify the node parameters according to your needs. For example, to enable a hardware component, change its `status`:
    
    ```
    &i2c2 {
        status = "okay";
    };
    ```
    
4. Save the file and exit the editor.

## 3. Compiling the Modified DTS File

After making changes, you need to compile the DTS file into a DTB file:

```
make DTBS
```

This command generates the modified DTB at:

```
arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/imx8mm-mecha-comet-m-gen1.dtb
```

## 4. Deploying the Modified DTB

Once compiled, the new DTB must be copied to the boot partition of your device:

```
cp arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/imx8mm-mecha-comet-m-gen1.dtb /boot/
```

Or, if using a bootloader such as U-Boot:

```
scp arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/imx8mm-mecha-comet-m-gen1.dtb user@target:/boot/
```

After copying, reboot the device to apply the changes:

```
reboot
```

## 5. Verifying the Changes

To verify that your modifications are applied:

1. Dump the device tree in a readable format:
    
    ```
    dtc -I dtb -O dts /boot/imx8mm-mecha-comet-m-gen1.dtb -o modified.dts
    ```
    
2. Check if your changes are present in `modified.dts`.

## 6. Troubleshooting

- If the device fails to boot after modifying the DTB, revert to the previous DTB:
    
    ```
    mv /boot/imx8mm-mecha-comet-m-gen1.dtb.bak /boot/imx8mm-mecha-comet-m-gen1.dtb
    reboot
    ```
    
- If `make DTBS` fails, ensure you have the correct dependencies installed:
    
    ```
    sudo apt install device-tree-compiler
    ```
    
## Conclusion

Modifying the DTB allows customization of hardware configurations for the Mecha Comet device without kernel modifications. Always ensure proper testing before deploying DTB changes in production environments.
